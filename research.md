excerpt: "This."

I am motivated by problems at the intersection of biology and mathematics, and am interested in modeling and simulating physiological processes such as blood coagulation, intracellular transport, and metabolism. In particular, my research interests include dynamical systems, ordinary and partial differential equations, and parameter estimation.
