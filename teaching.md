I have had the opportunity to teach a wide variety of courses at University of Utah and at University of California, Davis.  

I am passionate about teaching pedagogy and training graduate student instructors in teaching best practices. I have participated in the Utah Math Instructor Training Workshop, which is an annual workshop that includes practice lectures, workshops on campus-wide resources, and teaching pedagogy workshops.
