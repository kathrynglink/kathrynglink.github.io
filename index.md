Since Fall 2020, I am a Krener Assistant Professor in the [Department of Mathematics](https://math.ucdavis.edu/ "Department of Mathematics") at University of California, Davis, where I am working with [Robert D. Guy](https://math.ucdavis.edu/~guy/ "Robert D. Guy") and [Becca Thomases](https://math.ucdavis.edu/~thomases/ "Becca Thomases"). Prior to UC Davis, I completed my Ph.D. in mathematics in the [Department of Mathematics](https://math.utah.edu "Department of Mathematics") at the University of Utah under the supervision of [Aaron L. Fogelson](https://math.utah.edu/~fogelson "Aaron L. Fogelson" ).
